- Install latest CMake and add it to PATH system variable
- Install NASM for libjpeg-turbo building. https://www.nasm.us


PROBLEM: 
      OpenSceneGraph not build, but it took some time building.
POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
      Sometimes OSG building is dropped by msvc with no heap space.
      Just try to rerun build proccess (you can skip other built libs like GDAL in the script) several times. It will build OSG libs one by one and eventually succeed.

PROBLEM: 
      osgQt Release version is not build.
POSSIBLE SOLUTION:
      If you have message "Active code page: 437" while openning cmd, then check this file: build\osgQt\build\Release\src\osgQt\osgQt5.vcxproj

      If in the beggining of the file you have the same message (twice), then you have to edit registry:
      Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor\Autorun
      and remove "chcp 437" value.
      
      Try to rerun BUILD_LIBS.bat script.
